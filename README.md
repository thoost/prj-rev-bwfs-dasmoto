# prj-rev-bwfs-dasmoto

I copied the urls for the four images, and pasted them into Ã¥ wordpad and saved it as a .rtf file, but that was not so smart.  
It worked fine on my computer, but here it just looks like an anthill.

I should have saved them as images in the same images folder I saved the dasmoto-images.rtf.

It was "impossible" to get the right results with image and backgound-color in the same <div>.  
The image turned up together with the background-color-.
